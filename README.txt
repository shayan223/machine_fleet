Currently the program generates two company agents and allows the user 
to choose how many machines each one gets as well as the max timesteps.

The simulation then operates the machines on each time step and checks for breakage



TODO (Phase 1):
*Add inventory
*Add money (well, its just a single variable, but theres nothing to use it on yet)
*Add ability to buy parts
*Add upkeep to detract from money based on parts in inventory
*Add ability to repair machine with parts


TODO: (Phase 2):
*Introduce customers to pay for service
*Track breakage to change customer distribution probability
*Add ability to track different parts or part types (perhaps) with different costs

TODO: (At Some Point)
*Add plots/monitors for all the different interacting values like money, inventory, etc.
